# HousePriceRegression

This project is comprised of two files for simplicity.
1. HousePriceRegressionPQD.ipynb -> This is the file with the regression and analysis
2. PQDfuncs.py              -> This is the file containing detailed implementations of functions I created for the project

The aim of this project was to implement robust Machine Learning principles and techniques to further my understanding of the subject.
